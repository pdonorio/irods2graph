--- ✄ -----------------------

TO DO:
 ☐ create notebook docker image for executing queries
 ☐ create docker images for graph and iclient
 ☐ use my separate git repo 'dockerizing' + git submodules
 ☐ deal with iRODS replica in the graph as a new node model
 ☐ add logs class
 ☐ adjust template for all rules

--- ✄ -----------------------

TO FIX:
    * show counts of irods element vs selected elements
    * irods replica concept
    * switch script to ipython:
        http://click.pocoo.org/5/exceptions/#what-if-i-don-t-want-that
    * python3 irods client? or stick with plumbus?
LATER ON:
    * Recover PID in production? http://hdl.handle.net/
    * rancher yaml for multi host configuration
